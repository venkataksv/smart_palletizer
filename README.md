Smart Palletizer
-----------------------------
Goal of this small repo is to detect pallets from a given set of 2D images & 3D scene clouds captured from 
an overhead 3D camera and perform detection / classification of the boxes into 2 categories (S / M ) of certain dimensions

Small box dimensions - [0.340, 0.250, 0.095] (in m)
Medium box dimensions - [0.255, 0.155, 0.100] (in m)

Completed Tasks 
- Box Detection (`box_detector.ipynb`)
- Planar patches detection (`plane_classifier.ipynb`)


To do tasks
- Point Cloud post processing
- Boxe Poses Estimation
